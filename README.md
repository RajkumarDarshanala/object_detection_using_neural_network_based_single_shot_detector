# object_detection_using_neural_network_based_single_shot_detector

this repository consisits of the complete file set required for an object detection to be done on a  video
it was implemented successfully on sypder3 where all the reuired conditions of packages were satisfied
note that this project is based on ssd (pytorch implimentation based single shot detector by max-de-groot) which is found to be one of the best algorithm for object detection.
